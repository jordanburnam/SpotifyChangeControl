                Let's be honest this whole thing is nothing more than a hobby for me so I am not spending a lot of time or resources on security or reliability. <b>You will be using this at your own risk!</b> That being said I have tried to use the best judgement I could when thinking through the ways in which this application works. I <b>DO NOT</b> have you create an account and I <b>DO NOT</b> store anything but your spotify user id and your token. I look up your email address from the spotify web api at runtime! I keep the spotify user id in a separate storage system. I also have my code on github that anyone with the technical know how can review and validate my statements. It also allows it to be vetted and verified by others, not just me.
                Keep in mind there is still a risk. If someone were to attack me and were able to get your spotify token and they somehow managed to get my private id then they would be able to read your spotify library and more importantly your private spotify profile which includes your date of birth and your email address. I would prefer spotify expose ones email without their date of birth but that isn’t here nor there.
