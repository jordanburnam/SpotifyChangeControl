<h3> 1. Authorize Me!</h3>
<p>In order to access your spotify playlists you have to authorize my app to do so. This is a pretty simple process in which you click a button on my site and sign into Spotify.</p>
<h3>2. Worship Me!</h3>
<p>You then need to realize I am better than you and just accept it!</p>
<h3>3. Check</h3>
<p>I hope in the future to have this application email users but for now you will have to do it the old fashioned way by logging in!</p>
