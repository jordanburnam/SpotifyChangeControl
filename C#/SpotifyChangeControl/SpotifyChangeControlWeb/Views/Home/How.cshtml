<h1>How?</h1>
<h2>It's Easy, Just three simple steps!</h2>

<h3> 1. Authorize Me!</h3>
<p>You click the "I know you are better than me" button below which will have you redirected to the spotify web page to log in. 
    You will then be prompted by Spotify as to whether or not you would like to grant my application access to your spotify account! 
    For more details about what information I store and what I have access to, along with your rights using the Spotify Token see my @Html.ActionLink("What", "What");  page.</p>
<h3>2. Worship Me!</h3>
<p>You then need to realize I am better than you and just accept it!</p>
<h3>3. Await eMail</h3>
<p>My application will notify you via email should changes happen. I have not decided on how often yet and would like to make it configurable in the future. Just wait for the email and be happy I let you exist in my universe!</p>
